Greyhole setup via ansible
================

An Ansible playbook for installing and configuring [greyhole](http://www.greyhole.net/)

The playbook is targeted to work on Ubuntu. If you want greyhole on a Fedora
based distro you should probably checkout [Amahi](http://www.amahi.org)

Playbook is far from complete. Still needs to configure a lot of things.

WIP for installing and configuring greyhole.

- [ ] set variables for mounting drives
- [ ] set variables for shares
- [ ] create ansible-samba playbook for configuring shares
- [ ] make .sql import idempotent
